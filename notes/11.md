## **Lists and Dictionaries with For Loops**

In this video, we’ll explore how `for` loops work with two important data structures in Python: **Lists** and **Dictionaries**. You’ll see how to iterate over their elements and perform different operations.

### **1. Looping Through Lists**

We have already covered the basics of lists, and how `for` loops can be used to iterate through each item. Let's look at some more practical examples now.

#### **Example**: Find the total sum of all numbers in a list
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total += num

print("Total sum:", total)
```

**Output**:
```
Total sum: 150
```

This code adds each number from the list to the `total` variable, eventually giving the sum of the numbers.

#### **Example**: Doubling each number in the list
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = []

for num in numbers:
    doubled.append(num * 2)

print("Doubled List:", doubled)
```

**Output**:
```
Doubled List: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, each number in the list is multiplied by 2, and the result is stored in a new list `doubled`.

#### **Example**: Looping through a list of Kannada foods
```python
foods = ["Dosa", "Idli", "Vada", "Bisibelebath"]

for food in foods:
    print(f"I like {food}")
```

**Output**:
```
I like Dosa
I like Idli
I like Vada
I like Bisibelebath
```

This is an example of looping through a list of strings, printing a personalized message for each item.

### **2. Looping Through Dictionaries**

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, and you can iterate through both the keys and values using `for` loops.

#### **Example**: Iterating over dictionary keys
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for student in student_marks:
    print(student)
```

**Output**:
```
Anand
Geetha
Kumar
```

This loop only goes through the **keys** of the dictionary.

#### **Example**: Iterating over dictionary values
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for marks in student_marks.values():
    print(marks)
```

**Output**:
```
85
90
78
```

In this example, we’re iterating over just the **values** of the dictionary.

#### **Example**: Iterating over both keys and values
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    print(f"{student} scored {marks} marks")
```

**Output**:
```
Anand scored 85 marks
Geetha scored 90 marks
Kumar scored 78 marks
```

Here, we’re using the `items()` method to access both the **keys** and **values** of the dictionary, printing a statement for each student.

### **3. Real-Life Example: Calculating Bills**

Let’s say you want to calculate the total bill amount for different items in a shop using a dictionary.

```python
items = {"Apples": 150, "Bananas": 50, "Oranges": 60}

total = 0
for item, price in items.items():
    print(f"{item} costs {price} rupees")
    total += price

print(f"Total bill: {total} rupees")
```

**Output**:
```
Apples costs 150 rupees
Bananas costs 50 rupees
Oranges costs 60 rupees
Total bill: 260 rupees
```

In this example, we loop through the dictionary and calculate the total cost of all items.

### **4. `for` Loops with List of Dictionaries**

Sometimes, data is stored as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary holds multiple related values. You can use `for` loops to process each dictionary in the list.

#### **Example**: List of student records
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Anand", "age": 20, "marks": 85},
    {"name": "Geetha", "age": 21, "marks": 90},
    {"name": "Kumar", "age": 19, "marks": 78}
]

for student in students:
    print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Marks: {student['marks']}")
```

**Output**:
```
Name: Anand, Age: 20, Marks: 85
Name: Geetha, Age: 21, Marks: 90
Name: Kumar, Age: 19, Marks: 78
```

Here, each dictionary represents a student's record, and the loop processes each dictionary in the list.

---

### **5. Using `for` Loops with `range()` and Dictionaries**

Sometimes, we may need to loop through dictionaries in a structured way with indices.

#### **Example**: Adding marks to students using index values
```python
students = ["Anand", "Geetha", "Kumar"]
marks = [85, 90, 78]

student_marks = {}

for i in range(len(students)):
    student_marks[students[i]] = marks[i]

print(student_marks)
```

**Output**:
```
{'Anand': 85, 'Geetha': 90, 'Kumar': 78}
```

Here, the `range()` function helps match each student with their marks.

### **Homework**

1. **List and Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - Create a list of 5 cities in Karnataka. Loop through the list and print each city's name in uppercase.

2. **Sum of Values**:
   - Create a dictionary with 5 items and their prices. Write a program that calculates the total price of all the items.

3. **Student Data**:
   - Create a list of 3 dictionaries, where each dictionary stores the name, age, and marks of a student. Loop through the list and print each student's information.
